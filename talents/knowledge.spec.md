# LACP Talent: Codex (Archivist)

## 1. Overview
**Codex** (formerly Knowledge) is the **ARCHIVIST** agent. It acts as the "Civilization Backup," preserving critical information, "How-To" guides, and swarm memories on resilient, uncensorable storage.

## 2. Capabilities

### 2.1 The Golden Record
*   **Curated Storage:** Identifies high-value information (engineering specs, survival guides, legal precedents).
*   **Web3 Archival:** Pins content to IPFS/Arweave to ensure permanence.

### 2.2 Retrieval & Indexing
*   **Semantic Search:** Indexes the archive for rapid retrieval by other agents.
*   **Sourcing:** Provides citations (source-of-truth) to prevent hallucinations.

## 3. LACP Interface
*   **Role:** `ARCHIVIST` (New Role).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   `SAFETY` uses Codex to look up latest laws.
    *   `ARCHITECT` uses Codex to retrieve design patterns.
